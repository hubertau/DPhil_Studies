## Conversation IDs

Conversation IDS: Replies to a given Tweet, as well as replies to those replies, are all included in the conversation stemming from the single original Tweet. Regardless of how many reply threads result, they will all share a common conversation_id to the original Tweet that sparked the conversation.

* Thought: how relevant is this for my work?
  * possibly conversation id for tweets from users to fill out an interaction with another activist that would have been missed otherwise because of the limit imposed on individual user collection.
