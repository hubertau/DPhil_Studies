* after the last batch of bsc runs I FINALLY have the eot_tokens and rt tokens removed, but clearly there is still more to clean.
* TODO: comment, clean code, commit changes
  * have cleaned up countvectorizer a bit. Fixed list.extend method because it's an inplace method
* TODO: implement collecting hashtags in vocabulary too.
  * done.
* TODO: further cleaning
  * trying to remove ellipses with regex in the iterator phase so it doesn't need to be processed at all.
  * some error introduced because of the vocab building, inserting and <extend> method into the vocab list FIXED
  * remove URLs too
  * remove user mentions - this can be a separate piece of information to collect
* deleted the archive postprocess script, it's useless now I'm not saving to csv
