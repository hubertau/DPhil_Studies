# meeting with Balazs

* FAS collection used this month - 10m for 6 months of tweets.
* BSC results up and running, I can send you the files
* Things suggested to work on:
	* I now have a couple months of FAS on a fuller set of collection data
	* I can start more systematically looking through accounts with clustering information to (a) control for word use to decode who is an activist or not
		* (b) prepare sampling of users for July collection.
---
* use individal plots of course
* strength of dyad
	* follow collaborator
	* normalise histories where a bot was introduced and where a bot was not introduced.
	* counterfactual comparison
	* marginals like account same age, collaboration intensity, normalise out seasonality dynamics, approximate true effect of introduction of bot.
	* seasonality probably not relevant here.

* we do expect an increase across metoo but activist should but compared to what?
* DO VISUALISATION on SPACE for sense of regions
	* correspondence analysis
	* pca, non metric muiltidimensional scaling MDS, correspondnece (bipartite)
	* e.g. measure distance from one cluster to another cluster
	* same measure generating clusters can be used to get distance

* baselines comparisons IMPORTANT!
	* need COUNTERFACTUALS

* distance metric between clusters!
* hashtag pool use
* hashtag cofrequency
* aggregate cofrequency link between clusters
